H: Learning attitudes and patience – cultural differences
	• Is there a relation between attitudes towards learning (several items on that in PANDA) and patience (time preference)?

	• Does this relation hold in every country?

	• Is it stronger in some countries? And could that difference be caused by cultural differences?
